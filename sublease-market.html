                Sublease Market is a startup located on college campuses that connects renters with tenants - simplifying, alleviating, and expediting the whole subleasing process. My role is rebranding their logos and graphics, as well as designing all marketing materials using Adobe Photoshop. 
                Below are my color palette examples and new logo designs, along with marketing materials.
            </p>

            <div class="color-pallete">
                <img src="images/colors.png" alt="cp1" class="center">
                <img src="images/colors2.png" alt="cp2" class="center">
                <p class="center" style="width: 75%;">Here are a few of the pallete examples I liked. I chose these specific colors because I wanted to animate how beautiful houses feel. 
                    When I think of beautiful homes, I think of the fall time and the sun shining. I wanted to use a lot of natural colors that make you think
                    of the beauty nature holds. I wanted that experience to be replicated in the design of Sublease Market so it could feel like an easy, and homey
                    experience.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="full-mock-up">
                <img src="images/sm-logo2.png" alt="smmockup" class="center">
                <p class="center" style="width: 75%;">Here was my first full graphics and logo ideas mock up for a specific color pallete. I wanted the design to be consistent
                    but also able to morph into other graphics if needed.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="key-designs">
                <img src="images/SM-logo.png" alt="keys" class="center">
                <p class="center" style="width: 75%;">Here are some other possible color combinations for the key logo since we had not decided on a specific pallete yet.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="merge-keys">
                <img src="images/merge.png" alt="mergek" class="center">
                <p class="center" style="width: 75%;">I really liked the merge key logo idea so I made a few other color combinatios for that logo as well.
