            <p>
                Hi! Nice to meet you, my name is Angela Young. I am currently a junior at University of Michigan School of Information studying User Experience and Design with a Minor in Computer Science. 
                From a young age, I have always been very tech-savvy and love using those skills to further my creative mind. A quote that resonates with me is “Art challenges technology, and technology inspires art.” 
                I am very passionate about the intersection of technology and design. I want to use my skills to bring joy and positivity to the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in small suburb of Cleveland, OH. I am proud to be a part of a large and loud Italian family. I am a born leader and constantly strive to lead by example. 
                I am comfortable in the driver’s seat and always want to bring optimism to each project. I often find myself very spread out amongst projects as my brain cannot decide whether it is right-brain dominant or left-brain dominant. 
                I enjoy the structure and intellectual challenge of programming projects, as well as the freedom and fluidity of creating art.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have always been very open-minded and new experiences often excite me. I love to challenge myself to constantly learn and broaden my knowledge about the world. I am passionate about the environment and keeping our Earth a clean and livable place for generations to come. 
                I often find escape in some form of entertainment, whether that be movies, tv-shows, or a fictional book. My current favorites are: Django Unchained, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Where The Crawdads Sing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a leader, innovator, and maximizer. I love to challenge myself and constantly open myself to new experiences. I’m always happy to chat about my studies, skills, favorite entertainment or about anything else!
            </p>
